# Wholesale analysis

## Resume
**Title** : Wholesale & Retail Orders analysis

In this project, I showcase the power of Python as a data analysis tool — from cleaning messy datasets to uncovering valuable insights. 
Python is not just a popular programming language; it's a go-to solution for data analysts worldwide thanks to its speed, flexibility, and vast ecosystem. 
This project highlights how Python can transform raw, unstructured data into clear answers that support smarter decision-making.

The journey begins with data preparation, where I clean, organize, and validate the data. 
From there, I apply analytical techniques to explore patterns and trends, and finally, I answer key business questions with meaningful visualizations and insights. 
This project reflects not only technical fluency in Python but also a sharp focus on extracting insights that matter.

## Source
The data was collected from [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/wholesale-and-retail-orders-dataset)

## Goal
This project sets out to explore how data can drive smarter decisions in retail. 
Using Python, we dive deep into the store's transaction records to answer critical business questions with clarity and precision. Here's what we aim to uncover:

**1. Identify the Most Profitable Product**.
Calculate and compare profit percentages to find out which product brings the highest return relative to its cost.

**2. Track Monthly Profit Trends Across Years**.
Analyze profit performance month over month, across multiple years, to understand seasonality and growth patterns.

**3. Explore Price Sensitivity**
Investigate whether lower cost leads to higher profit, and whether cheaper products are purchased more frequently.

**4. Reveal the Top 3 Best-Selling Products in the Latest Year**
Determine which products captured the most attention from customers recently — a key insight for inventory and marketing planning.

**5. Measure Delivery Performance**.
Examine how long it takes to deliver products to customers each month using both the longest delivery time and central tendency indicators like the median.

**6. Identify Active Loyal Customers**.
Find customers who made purchases more than three times in the last three months of the most recent year — and reward them with targeted promotions.

**7. Understand Customer Loyalty Status**
Classify these loyal customers by their highest achieved status (Silver, Gold, or Platinum) to support strategic loyalty and retention programs.


## Summarised
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of retail transaction data using Python, focusing on identifying business opportunities through data-driven insights. 
It reveals that golf products generate the highest profit percentage, followed by racket and swim sports, with winter and team sports showing lower profitability. 
Profit trends over the years display a consistent seasonal pattern, with earnings peaking in December across all years, particularly in 2021.
Additionally, the relationship between cost and profit, as well as price and quantity ordered, confirms that lower-cost products dominate in volume, while higher-cost items, although fewer, yield greater individual profit.

Further analysis identifies clothes as the most frequently ordered product category in the latest year, outpacing assorted sports articles and outdoor products. 
Order-to-delivery data shows an increasing trend in delivery delays toward the end of the year, with the longest delays occurring in December. 
However, average delivery time records are zero, suggesting a data quality issue that needs to be addressed. 
These findings can inform inventory planning and delivery logistics.

Lastly, the study highlights 103 active loyal customers who made more than three purchases in the last three months of the latest year, each involving different products. 
Most of these customers fall under the Silver status tier, followed by Platinum, with Gold being the least common. 
This distribution offers opportunities to design targeted loyalty programs and retention strategies, especially for Silver-tier customers who show strong engagement and potential for elevation to higher tiers.

## Verdict 
In conclusion, the analysis reveals clear opportunities for business growth by focusing on high-margin products like golf equipment, optimizing inventory for best-selling categories such as clothes, and addressing delivery delays, especially in peak months. 
Additionally, nurturing the highly engaged Silver-tier customers through targeted loyalty programs could significantly enhance customer retention and long-term profitability.
